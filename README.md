# Pkcs11CppWrapper
This project is suppsed to be a very thin layer on top of the Pkcs11 C headers to give it a C++ approach and support dynamically loading implementations of the PKCS11 libs under different OSs. 

Right now it is just a sketch project with nothing really useful. Further info will be added when and if development progresses.
